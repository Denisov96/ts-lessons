# Code comments

In TypeScript, as in many programming languages, comments are annotations within the code that are not executed but provide explanations or additional information for developers. TypeScript supports both single-line and multi-line comments. Here's how you can use comments in TypeScript:

## 1. Single-line comments

Single-line comments begin with `//` and extend to the end of the line. They are often used for brief explanations.

```ts
// This is a single-line comment
let myNumber: number = 42; // This comment explains the purpose of the variable
```

## 2. Multi-line comments

Multi-line comments start with /_ and end with _/. They are useful for longer explanations or comments that span multiple lines.

```ts
/*
This is a multi-line comment
It can provide more detailed explanations
about the code or its functionality.
*/

let myString: string = "Hello, TypeScript!";
```
