## Different types in TypeScript

A type refers to a category or classification that specifies which kind of data a variable can hold or which operations can be performed on that data. In computers all data is stored in binary format like this `01101000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111`. Depending on a type of data that same series of ones and zeros can mean different things. In it is of type `number` (integer) it will mean a number 448378203247. But if it is ASCII encoded `string` it will mean word "hello". Type is the context that programmer provides to computer so it can interpret binary data correctly.

In programming the source of a lot of bugs is mismatch of expected and actual data type. For example while writing a program you may expect to get an age of a person as number 31 but upon execution it get it as a string "31". Thus performing operations on that variable won't lead to expected outcomes. Typescript helps developers to track the types of data and hint if there are mismatches of data types in their code.

In TypeScript, like in many programming languages, there are several basic data types that represent different kinds of values. In the next chapters we are going to discuss some basic data types in TypeScript.
