# Basic TypeScript

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for building dynamic web content. It was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995 at Netscape. JavaScript gained popularity for its ability to bring interactivity to web pages or for the content of web pages (HTML and CSS) to change programmatically depending on user input. In 1997, it was standardized as ECMAScript, with subsequent versions evolving to include new features and improvements. Today, JavaScript is a key language for web development, used both on the client side (browser) and server side (Node.js).

TypeScript is like a smarter version of JavaScript built by Microsoft. It takes everything that JavaScript has to offer and includes types to a language. Types strictly define what type of data the given variable is which helps developers catch mistakes and bugs early on while writing code. It's a tool that makes coding easier and safer, especially when working on bigger projects. Today it is a defacto standard for large projects.
